 - She starts with 1000 HP, she drains 1 hp per hour and every time the player uses magic

# Plots

The system of exploitation
 - Scribes discovered a ritual to summon mother nature herself, trapping her in a human body
 - She is held captive in a secret facility, where she is forced to produce magic essence by bloodletting
 - The essence is sold as "magic potions" on the market
 - The society has become dependent on magic potions for their daily lives
 - Wheeled vehicles, driven by magic essence, are the main means of transportation for the rich
 - While Mother Nature is slowly dying, the world is slowly dying with her

The non-sense corporation
 - Handling "magic potions" is a lucrative business
 - The corporation is run by a bunch of greedy assholes
 - They exploit the workers and the environment
 - But they also acquire quite a management overhead
 - They also don't know what they are doing
 - Sabotaging themselves and being utterly incompetent and inefficient

The circle of violence
 - Push-backs against refugees
The cycle of life
The dystopian future
 - Youth imprisoned for trying to save the world
The joy of children
The exploitation of the old and poor


Death alone
 - There are some old people in the villages, that don't have any children
 - Their friends and family have died or left them
 - They would be dying alone, unseen and unheard

It's a mad world.
Luckily, the extremes of good and evil rarely exist in reality.
The world is not black and white, but shades of grey.
Perpetrators are often victims themselves.
Striving for virtue is a noble goal, but vices are part of human nature.
For a single person, the world is virtually unchangeable.
