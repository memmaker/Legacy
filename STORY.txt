# Opening

You step out of the portal and find yourself in an unknown world.
A hooded figure approaches you and speaks in your native language.
"Welcome to our lands, it will be essential for you to learn our language.
I can offer you two options:

You can either learn our language by reading this book.
It will take you probably about three days and the same number of food rations
to get through it. Food is expensive and hard to come by around here.

There is also the much quicker option of using a magic potion to boost your learning.
It will take you only a few minutes and the potions can be bought at the market
for a reasonable price.

What do you want to do?"

This is too much on the nose..

Plot, Character & Lore
-> Focus on characters

Plot (needs at least one)
 - Be original
 - Have a twist
 - Have something to say

Characters
 - Who are they?
   - The architect and his messenger
   - The chancellor and the kings of rats and cats
   - The wanderer
   - Lady Thea
 - What do they want?
 - What do they fear?
 - What do they love?
 - What do they hate?
 - What are their flaws?

# What should the game be about?
The self-destruction of mankind.
The destruction of nature by mankind.

# What do I want the player to feel?

-> I want a roller coaster of emotions.

He should start out confused but intrigued.

He'll encounter evil, oppression and injustice.

But he will gain hope and find allies.

His confidence will grow and he will feel powerful.

But then he will be betrayed or left alone.

And even all his power won't be enough to save the world.

He will be left with a feeling of emptiness and despair.

That can only be overcome by focusing on the good things in life.

Like family, friends and nature. Becoming a better person.

PROBLEM: In this scenario/setting the player choices cannot have a lasting impact on the world.
That's because it's basically a dystopian future, where the world is already doomed.

# Setup
Someone brought you to this world.
Obvious questions:

 - MAIN QUEST: How do I get back to my world?
 - OPTIONAL  : Who brought you to this world?
 - OPTIONAL  : Why did they bring you to this world?

# Central conflict: Magic vs. Nature

There comes immense power with magic.
Questions:
 - What is the source of magic?
 - Who controls this power?
 - Who watches the watchmen?
 - What is the price we pay for its use?
 - Is it worth it?
 - Is there a way to live without it?
 - Is there a way to live in balance with it?

# Mother Nature
 - She starts with 1000 HP, she drains 1 hp per hour and every time the player uses magic
 - Each MP the player spends is 1 damage to her
 - When the player uses magic to open her prison door, she will scream in pain because it will need a big amount of power

# Big Power always comes with a price

# Power is not always a sword
# The words of power are not magical
# They are spoken by the people
# And their leaders


# First small but complete Quest..
 - Gain access to the Tauci Prison Level 1
   - Acquire Lockpicks - POSSIBLE
   - Bash the door open, and either run or excuse yourself to the guards - POSSIBLE
   - Befriend the guards or intimidate them
   - Steal the key from the guards - POSSIBLE
   - Find the hidden backup key in the guards room - POSSIBLE
 -> What if that fails and you get caught?
   - You can kill the guards.
   - You can bribe the guards.
   - You can let them imprison you.

RPG Design
Why is the quest giver not doing anything himself?
Why doesn't he care if I do nothing?
Why does no one else care about the problem?
Why is the antagonist just waiting for me to come and kill him?


# Problems
 - If Monsters aren't really monsters, where do we provide combat?
   -> War Zones (there are factions at war, you can chose a side)
   -> Sports (there are arenas where you can fight for money)
   -> Thugs (there are thugs that attack you for money)
   -> The undead (there are undead that attack you for yet unknown reasons)
   -> The wild (there are wild animals that attack you for food)
   -> The police (there are police officers that attack you for breaking the law)
   -> Bounty Hunters (there are bounty hunters that attack you for money)
   -> Genuinely evil people (there are people that attack you for fun)

# NPCs
The dead girl on the stairs
The rich douchebag
The self-sacrificing mother
Mother Nature herself, who is the source of magic
Vater Staat
Die kleine Raupe Nimmersatt (verwandelt sich von einer Schlange in einen Vogel)
 - Let's not make it too literal and obvious
 - Wir benutzen das von mir gezeichnete Bild wenn der Spieler "Nova" als Namen eingibt

Das letzte Einhorn

# Plots

The system of exploitation
 - Scribes discovered a ritual to summon mother nature herself, trapping her in a human body
 - She is held captive in a secret facility, where she is forced to produce magic essence by bloodletting
 - The essence is sold as "magic potions" on the market
 - The society has become dependent on magic potions for their daily lives
 - Wheeled vehicles, driven by magic essence, are the main means of transportation for the rich
 - While Mother Nature is slowly dying, the world is slowly dying with her

The non-sense corporation
 - Handling "magic potions" is a lucrative business
 - The corporation is run by a bunch of greedy assholes
 - They exploit the workers and the environment
 - But they also acquire quite a management overhead
 - They also don't know what they are doing
 - Sabotaging themselves and being utterly incompetent and inefficient

The circle of violence
 - Push-backs against refugees
The cycle of life
The dystopian future
 - Youth imprisoned for trying to save the world
The joy of children
The exploitation of the old and poor


Death alone
 - There are some old people in the villages, that don't have any children
 - Their friends and family have died or left them
 - They would be dying alone, unseen and unheard
