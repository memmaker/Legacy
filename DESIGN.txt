# Annoyances
 - The dialogue dilemma
   - Adding the "join" keyword to the player knowledge base means every NPC can be asked this now
   - Otoh, learning about the "murder in town" should allow asking all NPCs about this
 - Saving / Loading
   - We cannot load from the LDTK when we visited an area before
   - Instead, when leaving a map, that map state has to be saved to disk
 - The intro dialogue seems random (and maybe remove "job" & "name"?)
 - I cannot click on equipment in the inventory screen and just select something different
 - Encounters need a definition in text files, like conversations

# Character customization
 - Name & Pro-noun
 - Map Icon
 - 12 Points:
   -> Split up into further skills each
   -> Determines the learning cap for these skills
 -> Signature Skill

 - Intellect
 - Psyche
 - Physique
 - Motorics

 -> If player wants to be a thief, let him be a thief
    -> Skill check success -> reward or even another opportunity
    -> Skill check fail    -> double down on options (Depending on skill)
 -> Give options in the PAST.. Flashbacks

A BELIEF as a gamemechanic.
It's a tradeoff like: Always draw your weapon in a dangerous situation
Can be enforced by the game, but can be selected by the player.

The Disco Elysium Approach:
In any given Situation, you will be able to choose depending on
your chosen abilities. Even after a failure.
 -> Choose between morale and health damage on failure
Failure is always part of the story, not a game over.

NOTE: Allow All Skills to be applied both inside and outside of combat

# A locked wooden door
## Approaches to Problem solving

# TODO
 - Inventory management - BASIC
 - Party movement - GOOD ENOUGH
 - Doors & Keys - GOOD ENOUGH
 - Containers - BASIC
 - Equipping items
 - Combat
 - Magic - BASIC
 - Vendors - BASIC
 - Journal
 - Save/Load
 - Main Menu
 - Line of Sight - GOOD ENOUGH


# Non-Contextual actions
 - Inventory - BASIC
 - Cast spells
 - Rest (to heal) - BASIC
 - Attack
 - Split up - GOOD ENOUGH

# Contextual actions
 - Move (w/a/s/d)
 - Look/Examine (look at something)
 - Take/Drop (inventory)
 - Use/Interact (with something)
 - Talk/Conversations (to someone)
 - Mount/Dismount (a vehicle)
 - Enter (a town)
 - Open/Close (a door/chest)

# Cool ideas
 - Allow knocking on locked doors
 - Magic is Mother Natures HP, the "Legacy" label on the top of the UI will turn into the damage you have done to nature
 - We should provide alternatives to using the nature potions for spellcasting
   - Staff of the Sun God
     - Can be used as a source of mana
     - Max Mana can be increased by meditating at shrines
   - Blood pact of the Vampires
     - You can drink the blood of humans to replenish your mana
   - The Book of the Dead
	 - You can sacrifice the souls of the dead to replenish your mana
   - An ancient artifact
	 - A machinery can extract mana from the artifact
 - Magic potions are valuable and expensive
 - The poor cannot afford them
 - You can spend magic potions to increase your strength
 - You can make a good amount of money selling mana potions
 - You can definitely become a Vampire
 - Party members should tell stuff and influence conversations
   -> Don't like some actions

# Spells
 - Need a scroll in the inventory of the caster
 - Has to consume "magic potion" beforehand
 - Can be combined for secret spell combinations

# Design Guidelines
 - No Monsters without a cause, given the right skill, you can negotiate with them
 - Magic is exploitation of nature
 - Quests will result in one of:
   - A flag change
   - A reward (XP, Items, Food, Gold)
   - Party members lost / gained
   - Valuable Information
 - Some Ultima Staples
   - Transport Vehicle
   - Rich world interactions (bake bread, forge swords, etc.)
   - Meditation at shrines
 - A gruesome murder case
 - What about the damsel in distress tropes (amalthea, mother nature..)??

# Experience
 - Track Experience by type
   - combat
   - quests
   - exploration
   - conversation

# Approach

 - As Contextual Actions on objects
   - Ignite (a torch)
   - Jimmy (a lock)
   - Climbing (climb a tree)
