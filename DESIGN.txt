# Annoyances
 - The dialogue dilemma
   - Adding the "join" keyword to the player knowledge base means every NPC can be asked this now
   - Otoh, learning about the "murder in town" should allow asking all NPCs about this
 - Saving / Loading
   - We cannot load from the LDTK when we visited an area before
   - Instead, when leaving a map, that map state has to be saved to disk
 - The intro dialogue seems random (and maybe remove "job" & "name"?)
 - I cannot click on equipment in the inventory screen and just select something different
 - Encounters need a definition in text files, like conversations
 - It's not possible to have a conversation with your followers
 - How to handle items without icons when dropping them?
 - Repeat last action will continue attacking dead enemies
 - Dialogue options will only depend on the skills of the Avatar, not the whole party
 - Scrolling windows (eg. skill window) could be a big higher and show an indicator when scrolling is enabled
 - Scrolls should not store the full path to their files
 - Save/Load of Objects fails
 - Hidden Items not hidden after loading
 - Dialogue missing from NPCs after loading

# Character customization
 - Name & Pro-noun
 - Map Icon
 - 12 Points:
   -> Split up into further skills each
   -> Determines the learning cap for these skills
 -> Signature Skill

 - Intellect
 - Psyche
 - Physique
 - Motorics

 -> If player wants to be a thief, let him be a thief
    -> Skill check success -> reward or even another opportunity
    -> Skill check fail    -> double down on options (Depending on skill)
 -> Give options in the PAST.. Flashbacks

A BELIEF as a gamemechanic.
It's a tradeoff like: Always draw your weapon in a dangerous situation
Can be enforced by the game, but can be selected by the player.

The Disco Elysium Approach:
In any given Situation, you will be able to choose depending on
your chosen abilities. Even after a failure.
 -> Choose between morale and health damage on failure
Failure is always part of the story, not a game over.

NOTE: Allow All Skills to be applied both inside and outside of combat

A (RE)-ACTIVE ANTAGONIST - Der Architekt
Should not sit in his lair and wait for the Player to level up and kill him

# What makes good combat?
 - High Stakes
 - Meaningful Choices
 - No Single Solution
 - Interesting Enemies
 - The possibility to change the approach

# What Skills / Attributes?
What do we want to measure?

SPECIAL?
 - Strength
 - Perception
 - Endurance
 - Charisma
 - Intelligence
 - Agility
 - Luck

Party Stats?
 - Food Preservation (max. 4 rations -> 10, 20, 30, 40..)

# Axes
 - Magic
   - From Nature
     - Through Dark means
     - Through Light means

# Primary Stats
 - Max Health
 - Speed (determines initiative & movement allowance)
 - Magic Affinity
    - Determines the effectiveness of potion consumption
    - How many spells you have available in combat
 - Physical Attacks (Melee, Ranged) / (Dark, Light) / (Magic, Physical)
 - Physical Defense (Melee, Ranged) / (Dark, Light) / (Magic, Physical)
 - Luck Bonus (Loot & Critical Hits)
 - Encumbrance (For chance to hit modifiers based on armor)
 - Performed rituals
    - How many gods you can talk to
    - Gained by finding the information in the world and performing rituals

# Avatar only
 - Knowledge Gained (increased by reading books which trigger knowledge flags) (Will activate specific topics and this only counts how many you know about)
    - Gained by reading books
    - Tracks the books you have read on important topics
    - Some spells scale off of this

## Add these first (only flags & counters)

## two types - flags only & flags + counters

-> These can be just flags
Art of theft (Sneak, Pickpocket, Lockpick, Steal)
 - More options per level
 - (Sneak, Pickpocket, Lockpick, Glasscutting, etc.)

-> These can be just flags
Social Skills (Deceive, Persuade, Intimidate, Bluff, Spot Lies) (Choose a specific technique per Level)
 - More options per level
 - (Persuasion, Intimidation, Bluff, Spot Lies, etc.)
 -> Do we still roll for failure? We draw from a bag of 1-10
 -> Does taking "Spot lies" then mean no NPC can effectively lie anymore?

-> Needs a counter
Outdoors Skill (Survival, Hunting, Fishing, Tracking)
 - More catch, more food per level
 - Harder to spot when resting

-> Needs a counter
Athletics Skill (Climbing, Swimming, Jumping, Running)
 - Reduce encumbrance per level
 - Increase speed per level

-> Just flags
Foreign Language Skill
 - Choose a language per Level
 - Animals, Monsters, etc.

-> Flags + Counter
Perception Skill (Spot Hidden, Danger Sense, Listen, Search)
 - More options per level
 - (Spot Hidden, Danger Sense)
 - Further levels increase range



## Save these for later
-> These are special and need coding support
Melee Combat Skills
 - Choose active/passive skills usable in battle
Ranged Combat Skills
 - Choose active/passive skills usable in battle

# A locked wooden door
## Approaches to Problem solving
 - Violence (bash it)
 - Magic (cast "open"/"fireball" spell)
 - Stealth (find a way around it)
 - Communication (ask someone for the key or let him open for you)
 - Money (bribe people or pay for a thief)
 - Clever manipulation of the environment (pick the lock)


# TODO
 - Inventory management - BASIC (needs nice UI)
 - Party movement - GOOD ENOUGH
 - Doors & Keys - GOOD ENOUGH
 - Containers - BASIC (moving stuff into containers, other containers than chests)
 - Encounters - BASIC (needs better engine support)
 - Dialogues - BASIC (needs better engine support)
 - Equipping items - BASIC (needs weapons and more loot variety)
 - Combat - BASIC - (needs ranged & spells, target selection & better UI & AI)
 - Magic - BASIC (needs more spells and better UI and effects)
 - Vendors - BASIC
 - Journal - GOOD ENOUGH (add a search)
 - Save/Load - BASIC
 - Main Menu
 - Line of Sight - GOOD ENOUGH

# What we won't do
 - Off the grid effects
 - Fluid fancy animations
 - Require Grinding
 - Level Scaling
 - Dumb Fights (Even Combat Encounters should be interesting)
 - Useless Skills


# Non-Contextual actions
 - Inventory - BASIC
 - Cast spells - BASIC
 - Rest (to heal) - BASIC
 - Attack - BASIC
 - Split up - GOOD ENOUGH

# Contextual actions - GOOD ENOUGH
 - Move (w/a/s/d)
 - Look/Examine (look at something)
 - Take/Drop (inventory)
 - Use/Interact (with something)
 - Talk/Conversations (to someone)
 - Mount/Dismount (a vehicle)
 - Enter (a town)
 - Open/Close (a door/chest)

# Cool ideas
 - Don't allow revival of party members?
 - Track the wealth of the party and let them be the target of thieves and robbers
 - Let them buy a house and deal with break-ins
 - The 4 Orb Stones in the UI corners can actually be found in the world, n/e/w/s
 - Allow knocking on locked doors
 - Magic is Mother Natures HP, the "Legacy" label on the top of the UI will turn into the damage you have done to nature
 - We should provide alternatives to using the nature potions for spellcasting
   - Staff of the Sun God
     - Can be used as a source of mana
     - Max Mana can be increased by meditating at shrines
   - Blood pact of the Vampires
     - You can drink the blood of humans to replenish your mana
   - The Book of the Dead
	 - You can sacrifice the souls of the dead to replenish your mana
   - An ancient artifact
	 - A machinery can extract mana from the artifact
 - Magic potions are valuable and expensive
 - The poor cannot afford them
 - You can spend magic potions to increase your strength
 - You can make a good amount of money selling mana potions
 - You can definitely become a Vampire
 - Party members should tell stuff and influence conversations
   -> Don't like some actions

# Spells
 - Need a scroll in the inventory of the caster
 - Has to consume "magic potion" beforehand
 - Can be combined for secret spell combinations

# Design Guidelines
 - No Monsters without a cause, given the right skill, you can negotiate with them
 - Magic is exploitation of nature
 - Quests will result in one of:
   - A flag change
   - A reward (XP, Items, Food, Gold)
   - Party members lost / gained
   - Valuable Information
 - Some Ultima Staples
   - Transport Vehicle
   - Rich world interactions (bake bread, forge swords, etc.)
   - Meditation at shrines
 - A gruesome murder case
 - What about the damsel in distress tropes (amalthea, mother nature..)??

# Experience
 - Track Experience by type
   - combat
   - quests
   - exploration
   - conversation

# Approach

 - As Contextual Actions on objects
   - Ignite (a torch)
   - Jimmy (a lock)
   - Climbing (climb a tree)
