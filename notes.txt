# Annoyances
 - The dialogue dilemma
   - Adding the "join" keyword to the player knowledge base means every NPC can be asked this now
   - Otoh, learning about the "murder in town" should allow asking all NPCs about this

# Non-Contextual actions
 - Inventory - BASIC
 - Cast spells
 - Rest (to heal) - BASIC
 - Attack
 - Split up - GOOD ENOUGH

# Contextual actions
 - Move (w/a/s/d)
 - Look/Examine (look at something)
 - Take/Drop (inventory)
 - Use/Interact (with something)
 - Talk/Conversations (to someone)
 - Mount/Dismount (a vehicle)
 - Enter (a town)
 - Open/Close (a door/chest)

# TODO
 - Inventory management - BASIC
 - Party movement - GOOD ENOUGH
 - Doors & Keys - GOOD ENOUGH
 - Containers
 - Equipping items
 - Combat
 - Magic
 - Vendors
 - Journal
 - Save/Load
 - Main Menu
 - Line of Sight - GOOD ENOUGH

# Approach

 - As Contextual Actions on objects
   - Ignite (a torch)
   - Jimmy (a lock)
   - Climbing (climb a tree)
