Are you with the guild?"

into a triangle while
talking to you.

"Gosh, I'm so glad to
see you. I lost my tools
last night."

"It's a bit embarassing.
I was trying my final
test for the guild."

"I had to run away and
lost my leather case
when I dived out of the
window."

"It was one of the houses
on the east side of town."
