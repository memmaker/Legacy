You might have met that =chancellor= named Spid Tauci?"

AddsKeyword: your offer?
Text: "He's the one who's been causing trouble around here.
He thinks he's the king, but he's just a miserable human being.
I'd like to make him disappear, if you know what I mean."

Key: subtle
Text: "Yes, I really like this approach.

Key: quiet
Text: "You could try to threaten them, or maybe kidnap or outright kill them.
+ Some will be easier to get rid of than others. Be creative."

Text: "You've met them already. They are outside, waiting for you.
+ When you got rid of a Tauci, tell the spy to take their place."
