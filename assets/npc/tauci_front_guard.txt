He is obviously a very
enthusiastic guard.

He is eager to explain.

"Now that you mention it,
we didn't have any
security issues for a
while. I guess I'm doing
a good job."

"Say, you wouldn't happen
to have some =spare time=?"

"I have some personal
matters to attend to. I
would be very grateful if
you could take over my

Please stand here and
don't let anyone pass
until I return."

"Ah, I see. Well, I guess
I'll have to wait until
later then."
He turns back to his
post.
