Since I have no one to talk to, I will just write my thoughts
down. I am not even sure if I am dreaming or not or if this is
reality. All I know is: Something is wrong.

Maybe it is just me. Maybe I am just going crazy.
Whatever, I guess I will just write down what happened.

I woke up in the middle of the night. I was sweating and my
heart was beating like crazy. I was here, here in Celador.

Apparently, I have always been here. I have a house and an
occupation. They say I am a blacksmith.

But something is wrong. Sometimes I remember things that
never happened. I remember a different life.

So I decided to find out what is going on.
I took my sword and my bow and ventured out into the world.

Celador is a strange place. It is an Island, but it is not
only surrounded by water, but also by a nothingness, that
the people call "The Void". No one knows what is beyond the
Void. No one has ever been there.

I have heard rumors that there are other Islands out there.
But I have never seen them.

There are other people with strange stories to tell. I have
met a man who called himself "The Wanderer".
He told me that he was "only passing through".

It seems clear that those four magical gemstones are the key
to all of this. I have heard that they are called "The Shards
of Creation". But seemingly no one knows where they are.

Although I am pretty sure, that "Spid Tauci" knows at least
where to find one of them. I am going to find him and ask
him about it.
