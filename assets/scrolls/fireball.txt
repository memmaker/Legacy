The great ball of Fire

Invocation: "In Flamis"

When I created Celador, I originally planned for it to have
a sun. But I underestimated the sacrifice that would be needed
for that exchange.

Bound by those pesky laws, I managed to provide the energy
needed to at least break off some fragments of a sun I found
on my travels.

I siphoned off the fire and heat from the sun, and created
the fire scrolls. By binding the flames to the words, I created
new words of power, and thus new spells.

We will see, what the inhabitants of Celador will do with
this.
