This is about writing lore for a computer game,
a CRPG called "Legacy".

The setting is medieval high fantasy combined with modern day politics and bureaucracy.
The basic idea being a society at roughly the beginning of the industrial revolution,
but instead of steam engines, they have magic.

Please write a book from the perspective of a character in the game.

The title is:
"The known history of Procul
by K. N. Roberts"

It needs to hit these points:
 - People were part of savage tribes, praying to ancient gods, their ancestors and spirit animals
 - They formed small villages, that's when their holy artifacts were lost
 - They formed a nation
 - Magic was discovered
 - There was a big war, called "The Last War". It was horrible.
 - The nation was destroyed and the people felt betrayed
 - An even bigger war happened, called "The Great War". It was even more horrible.
 - After the dust settled, the winners declared "The Just Divide", a Rule of Exploitation.
 - A rough idea of government and bureaucracy was formed
 - Political parties were formed
